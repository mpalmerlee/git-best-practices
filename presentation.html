# Why should I care about keeping the history clean?

## All my changes get into master no matter how I like to work with Git, so why should I care? What's useful about the log anyways?
--

- Easily find out what happened and why
--

- Cherry-Pick a feature or bug-fix across branches
--

- Rervert a change when something goes wrong

---

# Let's look at a few examples

---

# The Git purists guide to keeping the history clean

- Each commit should represent a logical and functional set of changes
--

- _Usually_ this also means one commit per feature branch and pull request
--

- Avoid keeping merge commits in master since they don't contain useful information and just add noise
---

# That's nice, but I just wanna focus on coding, give me the TL;DR on how to do it

- Keep one commit on your branch while rebasing with master

--

- Squash and merge

- Merge with --ff-only option to avoid merge commits:
`git merge master --ff-only
fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.`
